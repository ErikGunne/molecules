Molecules - a real time shared document plugin for coding together.

Written by Erik Gunne, Jakob Lindqvist and William Viktorsson.

This plugin was built as part of the course **5DV205 - Advanced distributed systems** at Umea University in the fall of 2018.

The plugin communicates with one of several servers running our implementation of **Raft** for a shared replicated state.

As of November 2018 this plugin is only feasible to use together with previously mentioned servers and does not function as a stand-alone plugin.

The hopes are to continue the work on this in conjunction with the course **5DV192 - Cloud Computing**. Applying membership changes to the Raft implementation should allow for building it into the Atom plugin and making it feasible for usage as a standalone product.
